Many programs, especially those with user interaction, have functions to undo or redo processing steps. Implementation usually requires providing a mechanism that produces an opposite of a particular action. These functions have an impact on an underlying data structure.
This Typescript module provides an undo class that can be used to implement a simple undo/redo mechanism in programs. Text-based data structures (strings) and indexable data structures (objects) are supported.

Since changes to individual system states are often incremental in nature, a function is provided which only records the differences in data structures between two actions (diff). To enable object comparability, complex data structures are normalized via the detour of the JSON storage format and their keys are sorted if necessary.

Data is kept in memory only if it differs from its direct predecessor.

## What can be done

Essentially, four **operations** are provided:

- The initialization of an undo/redo buffer as a constructor;
- The storage of the current state (retain);
- The restoration of the previous state (undo);
- The repetition of an undone state (redo).

Static **utility functions** are:

- Sorting by keys of a possibly nested JSON data structure;
- Determining differences (replace, insert, delete) between two texts or arrays;
- The conversion of a text based on the previously identified differences;
- A range operator similar to Python's.

Information about the **state** of the stack memory:

- Can an action be undone (canUndo)?
- Can an action be redone (canRedo)?
- How many steps can be undone (countUndo)?
- How many steps can be redone (countRedo)?

## How to use

To save the current state as a snapshot a value is passed to the *retain* function. The data type of the passed value must be the same as the one specified when the constructor was initialized. If the constructor is initialized with a string, retain cannot be called with an array, for example.

*Undo* returns a snapshot of the previous state as a result, if available. At the same time the current state is written into the buffer for *redo* actions. If there are no (more) previous states in memory, the current state is returned.

The *redo* function can be executed if *undo* was called before. If there are no future states in memory, the current state is returned. If the data structure is changed after *undo* and saved again using *retain*, all values in memory for future changes with *redo* are lost from this point on.

Since complex data structures are converted using the native JSON functions, a **replacer** parameter can optionally be passed to the *constructor* and the *retain* function, and a **reviver** parameter can optionally be passed to the *undo* or *redo* function. The description of how to use the parameters can be found on the [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/) pages.

## Interface

```typescript
type tString = Capitalize<string>;
type tIndexable = string | any[];
type tReviver = (key: string, value: any) => any;
type tReplacer = any;

interface iScript {
  pos: number;
  val?: string[] | string;
}
```

- constructor(data: T, max?: number, objKeySort?: boolean, replacer?: tReplacer);
  - data: Initializer. The *retain* function compares the first element to be filed with this value.
  - max (opt): How many operations can be undone?
  - objKeySort (opt): Sort objects in ascending order according to the key.
  - replacer (opt): Applied to the initializer if it is an object. [Mozilla doku](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#the_replacer_parameter)

- get countPast(): number;
- get countFuture(): number;
- get canUndo(): boolean;
- get canRedo(): boolean;

- retain(data: T, replacer?: tReplacer): boolean;
  - data: The data type must correspond to that of the initializer.
  - replacer (opt): Applied to data if it is an object. [Mozilla doku](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#the_replacer_parameter)

- undo(reviver?: tReviver): T;
  - reviver (opt): Applied to this first undo-element if it is an object. [Mozilla doku](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#using_the_reviver_parameter)
- redo(reviver?: tReviver): T;
  - reviver (opt): Applied to this first redo-element if it is an object. [Mozilla doku](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#using_the_reviver_parameter)

- static [diffScript](https://github.com/giffeler/undoh/wiki/Remainder-operator-vs.-modulo-operator)(older: tIndexable, newer: tIndexable): iScript[];
- static applyEdit(script: iScript[], older: tIndexable): tIndexable;
- static jsonSort(data: any): string;
- static range(start: number, end?: number, step?: number = 1);

## Examples

Here is a simple example to illustrate the principle of operation. After execution, the console should display "def" followed by "ghi".

```javascript
import Undo from "undoh";
let buffer = new Undo("");
buffer.retain("def");
buffer.retain("ghi");
console.log(buffer.undo());
console.log(buffer.redo());
```

The following example script shows how easy it is to use the Undoh class in a DOM environment. A total of four HTML buttons are created. The upper two are linked to the *undo* and *redo* function. The lower two buttons *create* or *remove* text input fields. Between one and a maximum of five text input fields can be created. The creation or deletion of a field and the modification of its content can be undone or redone.

Try it here: [Stackblitz online example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-undoh?file=index.ts)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script type="module" src="example.js"></script>
    <style>
        button,input { margin: 3px; }
        button { user-select: none; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

The constructor is instantiated with a type in the form Undo&lt;type&gt;. This is an incompatible extension compared to versions earlier than 1.2.

### example.ts

```typescript
import Undo from "./undoh.js";

type idval = { id: string; value: string };

const minInput: number = 1,
  maxInput: number = 5;

let buffer: Undo<idval>;

const add: HTMLButtonElement = document.createElement("button"),
  remove: HTMLButtonElement = document.createElement("button"),
  undo: HTMLButtonElement = document.createElement("button"),
  redo: HTMLButtonElement = document.createElement("button"),
  area: HTMLDivElement = document.createElement("div");

const updateButtonUndoRedo = (): void => {
    undo.textContent = `undo ${buffer.countPast}`;
    redo.textContent = `redo ${buffer.countFuture}`;
    undo.disabled = !buffer.canUndo;
    redo.disabled = !buffer.canRedo;
  },
  updateButtonAddRemove = (): void => {
    add.textContent = `add ${maxInput - area.childElementCount}`;
    remove.textContent = `remove ${area.childElementCount - minInput}`;
    add.disabled = area.childElementCount >= maxInput;
    remove.disabled = area.childElementCount <= minInput;
  },
  retain = (): void => {
    const content: idval[] = [...area.querySelectorAll("input")].map(
      (e: HTMLInputElement): idval => ({ id: e.id, value: e.value })
    );
    if (buffer) {
      buffer.retain(content);
    } else {
      buffer = new Undo(content, 10);
    }
  },
  create = (data: idval | null = null): void => {
    const input: HTMLInputElement = document.createElement("input");
    [input.id, input.value] = data
      ? [data.id, data.value]
      : [`${area.childElementCount + 1}`, ""];
    input.addEventListener("change", (): void => {
      retain();
      updateButtonUndoRedo();
    });
    area.appendChild(input);
  },
  redraw = (r: idval[]): void => {
    area.innerHTML = "";
    r.forEach((e: idval): void => create(e));
    updateButtonUndoRedo();
    updateButtonAddRemove();
  };

add.addEventListener("click", (): void => {
  create();
  retain();
  updateButtonUndoRedo();
  updateButtonAddRemove();
});

remove.addEventListener("click", (): void => {
  const input: HTMLInputElement = area.querySelector("input:last-of-type")!;
  input.remove();
  retain();
  updateButtonUndoRedo();
  updateButtonAddRemove();
});

undo.addEventListener("click", (): void => redraw(buffer.undo()));

redo.addEventListener("click", (): void => redraw(buffer.redo()));

document.body.appendChild(undo);
document.body.appendChild(redo);
document.body.appendChild(area);
document.body.appendChild(add);
document.body.appendChild(remove);

add.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click"));
```

Alternatively, when working with a replacer, the corresponding retain function can look like this: [Stackblitz online example using replacer](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-undoh-replacer?file=index.ts)

```typescript
retain = (): void => {
  const objects: string[] = ["id", "value"],
    input: HTMLInputElement[] = [...area.querySelectorAll("input")];
  if (buffer) {
    buffer.retain(input, objects);
  } else {
    buffer = new Undo(input, 10, false, objects);
  }
}
```
